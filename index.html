                <p>Almost at one year that's crazy. I'm so thankful to have you by my side every second and I hope you know that I'll always be there for you no
                    no matter what. You've been there through the good and bad times and I appreciate you so much for that. Honestly don't know what I would do
                    without you. I could be having a terrible day but when I hang out with you, BOOM, it just goes away. Movie nights, workouts, F&F have been 
                    great and I can't wait for spooky season to arrive. By the way my F&F skillzzzz OOF they're getting to a decent level, you know some good competition.
                    And OOOOO we're gonna be doing so many things together during spooky season, it's my favorite. I need to compile a list first though.
                    Anyways I know you typically got a lot on your mind from family, to summer internship, to Nike, but just know that everyhting is going to turn 
                    out great!! It's just a little reminder that greatness takes time, so don't rush anything or put so much weight on your back. Again if you 
                    ever need to talk about anything I'm here for you. AND OOOOO I hope you liked your suprise, it's been eating me up since WA. You know I can't 
                    keep secrets lol.. but LETS GO GIANTS!! Happy nine months! I love you so much baby <333333 </p>
                <p>Love,</p>
                <p>Your Bestie AKA Twinkie :)</p>
